# BFAL-gtseq

December 2022


Population assignment of Black-footed Albatross using GTseq and rubias. 

Primers were designed from lcWGS data and will be used for:\
(1) self-assignment of known-colony samples, and \
(2) assignment of bycatch to breeding colonies.

Data are generated on a MiSeq at the AFSC Genetics Program lab in Juneau, AK, \
bioinformatic analyses are performed on the NMFS HPCC, Sedna, based in Seattle, WA, \
and finally, analysis of microhaplotypes, genotype data, and locus-fidelity is performed on Diana's laptop.

gtseq_test1 - 353 loci in a single primer pool, each at 0.25uM \
gtseq_test2 - 351 loci in two separate primer pools, \
with variable concentrations based on read depth results from test1
